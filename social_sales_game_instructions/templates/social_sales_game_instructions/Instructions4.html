		<b>NOTE:</b> During the real game, <b>you will only have 60 seconds to submit your pitch.</b>  
		   After 60 seconds, the page will automatically submit an empty pitch, and you will receive 
		   a Total Pitch Score of ZERO for that round.  <b>If you repeatedly fail to submit your responses
		   before time runs out, you will be marked as a DROPOUT and you will not receive the $4.00
		   Active Participation Bonus. </b> Make sure you always submit your pitch in less than 60 seconds.
	</p>
	<p><big><b>Build your sales pitch for Company F</b></big></p>
	<p>
		Each round, you'll be asked to <b><u>choose 3 platforms</u></b> to include in your pitch.  
		The video below demonstrates how this will work.  <b>To add a platform to your pitch, 
		just click on the name of the platform in the Platform List on the left, then click the ADD 
		button</b>.  The platform you selected will then move from the Platform List on the left to Your  
		Pitch on the right.  
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>If you change your mind</b> about a platform after adding it to your pitch, just <b>click on the 
		name of the platform in Your Pitch on the right, then click the REMOVE button</b>.  The platform you selected 
		will then move from Your Pitch back to the Platform List on the left.  When you are done editing your pitch, 
		click the blue SUBMIT button at the bottom of the page.
