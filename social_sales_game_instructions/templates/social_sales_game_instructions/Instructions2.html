	<p><i>(Read these instructions carefully. There will be a comprehension check at the end.)</i></p>
	<p>
		Each company's customers have similar business needs, so they tend to agree about which platforms 
		are more valuable than others. <b>Each company sells 20 separate platforms, and each platform has 
		a different average value to that company's customers</b>. The number of <b>points that a company's
		customers assign</b> to each of its platforms <b>will be close to that platform's average value</b>,
		but might be a few points higher or lower, depending on the customer.  Remember, to maximize your
		score (and <b>to maximize your bonus</b>), you need to <b>find the platforms that earn the highest 
		average point values</b> from each company's customers.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make sure this game is fair, you wonâ€™t receive any information about what each platform does.
		(This prevents people with professional experience selling software platforms from having an 
		advantage.)  <b>The only background information you will receive about each of the 20 platforms 
		each company makes is the platform's code name</b>.  However, <b>your customers DO know what each 
		platform does, and they will assign points to each platform based on how useful it is to them</b>.  
		Customers are not evaluating the platforms based on their code names, but on what the platforms do.
