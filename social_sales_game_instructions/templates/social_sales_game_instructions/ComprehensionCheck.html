	<h5>The Sales Game: Instructions</h5>
	<br><p>  
		You will work for <b>three different software companies</b>. Each company makes 20 different
		software platforms and each platform supports a separate key business process. <b>You will pitch
		each company's software platforms 15 times (to 15 different customers)</b>. Each company caters
		to a different type of customer, so the software platforms each company makes are unique.    
	</p>
	<p>
		Each time you make a sales pitch to a company's customer, <b>you can only include 3</b> of that
		company's <b>software platforms in your sales pitch</b>. Each time you make a pitch the customer
		will tell you how much they value the platforms in that pitch by assigning points to each platform.
		<b>We will add up the points the customer assigns to the 3 platforms in your pitch to come up with
		your Total Pitch Score</b>.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Each of the <b>platforms</b> a company makes has a <b>different average value</b> to its customers.
		Each company's <b>customers tend to agree about which of that company's platforms are the most 
		valuable</b>. A particular platform might earn slightly higher or lower points from different customers,
		but <b>the amount of points each customer assigns to that platform will be close to that platform's 
		average value</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will be matched up with <b>5 other people</b> to play this game. During each phase, you will all
		work for the same company.  On each round, <b>each person in your group will face a different customer</b>
		than the other members of the group. <b>If you and another player BOTH choose to share your results with
		each other, then you will BOTH be able to see each other's results</b> while you are working on your
		next pitch. However, if <b>EITHER of you chooses NOT to share your results with each other, then NEITHER
		of you will see each other's results</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will not receive any information about what each platform does.  But, <b>customers DO know what each 
		platform does</b>, and <b>they will evaluate each platform in your pitch based on how valuable that 
		platform's function is to their business</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To maximize your score (and <b>to maximize your bonus</b>), you need to <b>figure out which platforms 
		each company's customers value most</b>.  At the end of The Sales Game, <b>we will add up all of the Total Pitch 
		Scores you earned each round to determine your bonus</b>.
	</p>
