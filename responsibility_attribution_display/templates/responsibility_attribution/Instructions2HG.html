        <p>Below are examples of illustrations we will show you for each gymnast.  These illustrations are based on the gymnasts' past performances.  Some of the gymnasts you will see have <b>only competed in about 20 competitions</b> over the course of their careers.  You can think of these gymnasts as <b>novices</b>.  Other gymnasts have <b>competed in about 100 competitions</b>.  You can think of gymnasts as <b>experts</b>.
        </p>

        These illustrations are known as histograms.  Each dot in the histogram represents the score the gymnast received in one
        of his or her past performances.  Dots are stacked up on top of the score they represent.  For example, the two dots that appear above the 
        number 5 in Smith's histogram tell us that Smith received a score of 5 two times out of the past 20 performances.
       
        <div style="float:none; width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; height: 300px;">
            <!-- LEFT BOX -->
            <div style="width:300px;height:230px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Smith's past 20 performances</strong></p>
            <img style="height:200px; align: center" img src="{% static dots1 %}"/>
            </div>
            <!-- RIGHT BOX -->
            <div style="width:300px;height:230px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Jarrod's past 100 performances</strong></p>
            <img style="height:200px; align: center" img src="{% static dots2 %}"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>To create the illustrations above for Smith and Jarrod, we used all 20 of Smith's past performances, and all 100 of Jarrod's past performances.  You can check this by counting the number of dots in Smith's and in Jarrod's histograms.  You'll notice that most of the dots in Smith's histogram are on the high end of the scale, which lets us know that Smith has usually scored high in the past.  On the other hand,
        Jarrod's dots mostly appear on the low end of the scale, which tells us that Jarrod usually scored low in the past.</p>
