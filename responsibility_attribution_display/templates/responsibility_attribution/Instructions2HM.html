        <p>Below are examples of illustrations we will show you for each gymnast.  These illustrations are based on the gymnasts' past performances.  Some of the gymnasts you will see have <b>only competed in about 20 competitions</b> over the course of their careers.  You can think of these gymnasts as <b>novices</b>.  Other gymnasts have <b>competed in about 100 competitions</b>.  You can think of gymnasts as <b>experts</b>.
        </p>

        These illustrations are known as heat maps.  Scores received more frequently are marked in a darker red color than those received less frequently.

            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Smith's past 20 performances</strong></p>
            <img style="height:75px; align: center" img src="{% static heat1 %}"/>

            <div style="width:350px;height:130px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Jarrod's past 100 performances</strong></p>

        <p>To create the illustrations above for Smith and Jarrod, we used all 20 of Smith's past performances, and all 100 of Jarrod's past performances.  you can see that Smith tended to receive high scores in the past, marked by darker red colors near the right-end of 
        the heat map.  You can also see that Jarrod tended to receive low scores in the past, marked by darker red colors near the left-end
        of the heat map.</p>
