    </h3>

    <p>
        You have been paired with two other players to form a group of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} people.
        Each of you will be asked to choose a number between 0 and {{ Constants.guess_max }}.
        The winner will be the participant whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all chosen numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>YOUR GROUP:  Your group consists of you and two other participants <u>who have not participated
        in this experiment before</u>.  It is unlikely your partners will already know a winning strategy for this game.  In fact, novice players will often just select a random number between 0 and 100.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The winner of each round will receive {{ Constants.jackpot }}.
        In case of a tie, the {{ Constants.jackpot }} will be equally divided among winners.
    </p>

    <p>This game will be played for {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds.</p>
