		<b>NOTE:</b> During the real game, <b>you will only have 60 seconds to submit your pitch.</b>  
		   After 60 seconds, the page will automatically submit an empty pitch, and you will receive 
		   a Total Pitch Score of ZERO for that round.  <b>If you repeatedly fail to submit your responses
		   before time runs out, you will be marked as a DROPOUT and you will not receive the $4.00
