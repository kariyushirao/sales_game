    <h3 class="panel-sub-heading">Instructions</h3>
        <p>In this experiment, your task is to determine responsibility for the outcome of a gymnastics competition. 
        Gymnasts will compete as individuals in this competition, and each gymnast has a specialty event that s/he performs.
        </p>
        <p>Here is how the gymnastics competition works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each gymnast performs a rehearsed set.</li>
            <li>A panel of judges assigns each gymnast a score between 0 and 10 for that gymnast's individual performance. </li>
            <li>To advance to the next stage of the competition, a gymnast's <strong>score must meet or exceed 5 points.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Gymnasts vary in their performance history. Some gymnasts most often receive high scores, others may receive a wide 
        range of scores, and others may consistently receive low scores.</p>
        <p>A number of factors can affect a gymnast's outcome in a particular competition, some that are within the gymnast's control, and some that are not. For example, the quality of gymnasts' performances may be affected by how well they trained, how much they rehearsed their set, or even how well they slept the night before. Gymnasts' outcomes may also be affected by the quality of the facilities in which the competition takes place, the quality of the competitors against whom they are compared, and even slight deviations in the standards held by different panels of judges.</p>

        <p><b>Below are examples of two types of illustrations we will show you for each gymnast.  These illustrations are based on the gymnasts' past performances.  To create these illustrations, we randomly sampled either 20 or 100 of each gymnast's past performances.</b></p>

        The first type of illustration you will see are histograms.  Each dot in the histogram represents the score the gymnast received in one
        of his or her past performances.  Dots are stacked up on top of the score they represent.  For example, the two dots that appear above the 
        number 5 in Smith's histogram tell us that Smith received a score of 5 two times out of the past 20 performances.
       
        <div style="float:none; width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; height: 300px;">
            <!-- LEFT BOX -->
            <div style="width:300px;height:230px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Smith's past 20 performances</strong></p>
            <img style="height:200px; align: center" img src="{% static dots1 %}"/>
            </div>
            <!-- RIGHT BOX -->
            <div style="width:300px;height:230px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Jarrod's past 100 performances</strong></p>
            <img style="height:200px; align: center" img src="{% static dots2 %}"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>To create the illustrations above for Smith and Jarrod, we randomly sampled 20 of Smith's past performances, and 100 of Jarrod's past performances.  You can check this by counting the number of dots in Smith's and in Jarrod's histograms.  You'll notice that most of the dots in Smith's histogram are on the high end of the scale, which lets us know that Smith has usually scored low in the past.  On the other hand,
        Jarrod's dots mostly appear on the low end of the scale, which tells us that Jarrod usually scored low in the past.</p>

        <p>The second type of illustration you will see are heat maps.  We used the same random sample of either 20 or 100 past performances from
        each gymnast to create the heat maps.  Scores received more frequently are marked in a darker red color than those received less frequently.</p>

        <div style="float:none; width: 850px; margin: 0 auto; height: 175px;">
            <!-- LEFT BOX -->
            <div style="width:350px;height:130px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Smith's past 20 performances</strong></p>
            <img style="height:75px; align: center" img src="{% static heat1 %}"/>
            </div>
            <!-- RIGHT BOX -->
            <div style="width:350px;height:130px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Jarrod's past 100 performances</strong></p>
            <img style="height:75px; align: center" img src="{% static heat2 %}"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Here again you can see that Smith tended to receive high scores in the past, marked by darker red colors near the right-end of 
        the heat map.  You can also see that Jarrod tended to receive low scores in the past, marked by darker red colors near the left-end
        of the heat map.</p>

        <p>The heat maps provide the same information as the histograms, but some people find it helpful to look at the data both ways.
        Using the two illustrations of each gymnast's past performance, you will be asked to provide two responses: a prediction, and a 
        judgment of responsibility.</p>  
        <hr>
        <p><b>Prediction phase:</b> Based on each gymnast's past performance, you will be asked to predict how likely it is that each gymnast will earn a score of at least 5 points, and advance to the next stage of the competition.  After you make your prediction, we will show you the score the gymnast actually earned by marking it on the heat map.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of scores received by the two gymnasts above, Smith and Jarrod.</p>

        <div style="float:none; width: 850px; margin: 0 auto; height: 175px;">
            <!-- LEFT BOX -->
            <div style="width:350px;height:130px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Smith's score today: 9 points</strong></p>
            <img style="height:75px; align: center" img src="{% static curr1 %}"/>
            </div>
            <!-- RIGHT BOX -->
            <div style="width:350px;height:130px; float:left; padding:10px; margin:16px">
            <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Jarrod's score today: 3 points</strong></p>
            <img style="height:75px; align: center" img src="{% static curr2 %}"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        We can see that Smith scored 9 points today, marked by a black dot on Smith's heat map.  Smith gets to move on to the next round of today's competition, because a score of 9 surpasses the 5 point threshold for success.  We can also see that Jarrod scored 3 points today, also 
        marked by a black dot.  Jarrod will not get to move on to the next round, because a score of 3 misses the threshold of 5 points.
        <hr>

        <p><b>Responsibility phase:</b> </p>Depending on the outcome, you will be asked to indicate how much credit a successful gymnast deserves, or how much blame an unsuccessful gymnast deserves.</p>

        <p>Overall, you will see the outcomes for 42 gymnasts in the current competition. For each gymnast you will first make a prediction about his or her performance, and then assign responsibility for the outcome.</p>
    

        <p>After you've seen all 42 outcomes, we'll ask you a few short follow up questions (these won't take long at all).</p>
