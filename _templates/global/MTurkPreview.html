    <p>
        This HIT is an academic experiment about making judgments about 
        athletes' performances.  
    </p>

    <p>
        You will learn about the past performances of some athletes, and be asked
        to predict how well they will do in today's competition.  Then, you will 
        get to see how each athlete actually performed today, and you will be asked
        to determine how much responsibility the athlete should take for that 
        performance. The whole procedure should take about than 20 minutes to complete.   
    </p>  

    <p>
        After completing this HIT, you will receive a payment of $3.00.  If you
        encounter any issues while attempting the HIT, or have feedback for us, 
        please reach out to Kariyushi Rao (kariyushi@uchicago.edu).  We
        try our best to follow up with everyone within 24 hours.
